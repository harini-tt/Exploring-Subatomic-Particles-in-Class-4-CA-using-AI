## Exploring Subatomic Particles and Collisions in Class 4 CA using AI

### Abstract

Cellular automata have the capability of forming many complex structures from simple underlying rules, giving insight into how it could model real life physical behavior. This project relates fundamental and non-fundamental elementary particles (electrons, quarks, protons, neutrons, etc.) found at a subatomic level to repetitive structures found in class 4 cellular automata. Using an AI algorithm, it effectively identifies these particles by looking at many evolutions from random initial conditions. It then displays the various results of their collisions considering different phase shifts on a scattering matrix (s-matrix) and an interactive multiway graph.
